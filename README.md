I am a friendly, hard-working science graduate with varied work experience looking for a role where I can continue to develop my full stack skill set.  I enjoy working in a team and the opportunity to dive in and learn to apply new tools.

In university I studied Molecular and Cellular Biology during which I also worked in academic research labs in the areas of microbiology, neuroscience, and viral oncology. After moving to the UK, I began work as the 2nd employee in a startup digital development agency in central London. Later I joined the London brewing industry as an assistant brewer, ultimately becoming the operations manager. After leaving the brewery I started a dog training/boarding business, then worked in a pub, and was also a production brewer at another London brewery. I wanted to bring my passion for the learning and application of new skills to its ultimate medium, software development, so I chose to attend Makers Academy.

## Skills

#### Communication

  - As Operations Manager at Sambrook's Brewery, leading a cohesive and effective team meant ensuring that goals were clearly communicated, getting buy-in from team members by contextualising the requirements at hand, and aligning on how the work would be carried out.  I also made it a priority to keep precise and ongoing communication with all other departments, from helping the sales team take advantage of short term opportunities, to keeping the office informed about current stock levels.
  - At Makers my focus on the team dynamic during group projects prompted me to prioritise each member's personal goals and to make sure we started slowly, providing extra time for learning and looking for shared understanding of the problem and our approach, so that we could move fast later on.  This proved crucial to the success of each of the three projects linked above.
  - Communicating at varied levels has been a key part of my job across several of the roles I have held. At Explosive Titles, I worked closely with clients to understand their needs and goals for projects and translate them into technical requirements for developers. At the brewery, I developed and grew three contract brewing customer relationships as well as managed various one-off contracts. This involved helping brands to develop products by exploring their ideas with them, and communicating to them how they could best be achieved. As a brewer I also enjoyed translating the technical process of beer production for tour groups, who often let me know they had never had such a digestible explanation before.

#### Attention to Detail

  - At Sambrook's Brewery, my interest and confidence in interacting with the details of production forecasting and planning, yeast fermentation, quality control, and hazardous analysis, enabled me to develop new production processes, improve existing ones, and support the production team's efforts  -- ultimately expanding the brewery's production capacity and capabilities.
  - While at University I contributed to three different research labs by learning highly technical skills, digesting existing research on the topics, enjoying getting to the nitty gritty details, and using both to troubleshoot problems in projects.
  - At Makers, my attention to detail enabled me to quickly learn React Native, Express, MongoDB, and Expo to develop a mobile app with my team in only two weeks during the final group project.
  - I'm constantly motivated by a desire to learn and to look for the details of things, to see how everything works and to achieve elegant designs -- my favourite hobbies are extremely detail oriented: [PC hardware overclocking](https://www.3dmark.com/3dm/62326642), [custom watercooling](https://www.reddit.com/r/watercooling/comments/ny43qp/phanteks_p400a_case_mod_3rd_rebuild_overkill/), and [designing bases in Rust](https://www.twitch.tv/karmalater)!

#### Problem Solving

  - At Sambrook's Brewery as a Brewery Assistant I abstracted a system of how my team worked and developed a planning tool to help gain visibility on the work to be done for the week, using a giant whiteboard, which enabled better shift scheduling for staff and early identification of schedule sticking points.  I was promoted to Packaging Team Leader for that solution as it was a representation of my initiative in identifying and improving process related problems throughout my role.  I was promoted once more to Operations Manager, having continued to further refine the planning tool, even implementing a digital version in Excel, to accomodate a diverse set of activities while still maintaining useful layers of abstraction.
  - After joining the lab in Newcastle, I took over a project in which the mechanism of a DNA construct was not working as designed. I reviewed the experimental design and discovered unintentional characterists present that prevented successful use of the constructs.  Once I made changes to the DNA sequence to enable its intended functionality, the project was able to progress in gathering data.  I was later appointed manager of this lab to help nurture the development of five new student researchers.
  - At Makers utilizing my problem solving skills was vital for me to work with my team to adapt our modelling approach when using MongoDB and React Native compared to previous projects.

## Experience

**Makers Academy** (Mar '21 - May '21)  
  - Object-oriented programming, the single responsibility principle, and Ruby all synergised together to teach me the value of abstraction and simplification of code, which I use for planning and refactoring.
  - Test driven development has been an invaluable tool for writing effective code by letting complexity arise as it's needed, solving problems as they come up.
  - Pair programming helped me to reflect on my learning process, as the intense collaboration requires a lot of empathy and emotional intelligence for your partner and yourself.
  - In every group project I found value in the Agile methodology approach, as our prioritised communication and reflections were invaluable to finishing projects in such short time frames.
  - Mentorship from a Maker in an earlier cohort helped me to engage better with the program and was a source of motivation for the journey. I took the opportunity to become a mentor to a Maker in a subsequent cohort and I continue to use my emotional intelligence to create fruitful relationships.
